                    <ul>
                        <li id="VSync">
                            <b>Vertical Synchronization (V-Sync)</b> - technology allowing to keep display's scanout and refresh in phase to eliminate screen tearing,
                            at the cost of higher latency.
                            <br>
                            (Latency lowers along with refresh rate)
                        </li>
                        <li id="VRR">
                            <b>G-Sync | Freesync</b> - <b>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</b> technologies developed by NVIDIA and AMD respectively.
                            They allow the display to adapt its refresh rate to the framerate, allowing to use V-Sync at arbitrary framerates and reduce its latency<sup><a title="Why?" href="#annotation1">[1]</a></sup> .
                        </li>
                        <li id="MPO">
                            <b>Multiplane Overlays (MPOs)</b> - hardware scanout planes for the GPU. They allow for hardware image composition without any latency or performance penalty (for example displaying windows on top of each other), as well as
                            their hardware scaling and stretching.
                            MPOs are supported since Windows 8.1. Hardware capabilities vary between GPU manufacturers.
                        </li>
                        <li id="latency">
                            <b>Input Latency (lag)</b> - time between input event (mouse click, keyboard press) and the event being displayed on the screen. The lower the latency, the more responsive the game feels.
                            <br>
                            There are multiple sources of latency, varying from GPU/ CPU usage, display mode, framerate count and many more - most of them are covered in this guide.
                        </li>

                                Yes, despite popular misinformation, VRR alone doesn't get rid of tearing. It can minimize the rolling tear however, but that varies between displays, and such, it's not a guaranteed feature.
                                Additionally, the latency reduction applies <b>only</b> at framerates below V-Sync window (display's native refresh rate) - if framerate matches the native refresh rate, VRR engages V-Sync emulation.

                                <b>Flip Model</b> - presentation model first added in Windows 7 with D3D9Ex and upgraded in DXGI in Windows 8-10.
                                <br>
                                Allows "fullscreen-level" of performance and latency. Has native VRR support in Windowed Mode. Additionally, DXGI version supports tearing (V-Sync off) in Windowed Mode, HDR and has Multiplane Overlay (MPO) support.

                                DXGI variant is supported only in D3D10 and upwards<sup><a title="Why?" href="#annotation2">[2]</a></sup>, enforced only in D3D12, and exists only on Windows 8 and upwards.
                                <br>
                                D3D9Ex Flip Model is not feature matched and lacks any DXGI improvements.

                                <b>BitBlt Model</b> - older presentation model used by most applications.
                                While performing similarly to Flip Model in Fullscreen, in Windowed Mode it has worse performance and always-on V-Sync on top of already additional latency caused by additional copy operations due to being software composed.
                                <br>
                                The only presentation model for Windowed D3D9 (and lower), but still very common in D3D10 and D3D11 games.

                                <b>Fullscreen Exclusive (FSE)</b> - legacy method of displaying content where application takes complete ownership of the screen.
                                Has slow Alt-Tab due to display ownership transfer, can be problematic if games are badly coded and switch to odd resolutions or refresh rates by default. Can lose color profiles.
                                Despite that, it offers the best feature compatibility and perfomance for games that don't use Flip Model. Deprecated by Fullscreen Optimizations and Windowed with Flip Model for DirectX games.
                                <br>

                                lower latency, better color profile handling, and support for Windowed overlays (Xbox Game Bar, volume and brightness sliders etc.).
                                <br>
                                Because of being a Windowed Mode under the hood, it can break e.g. brightness control in old games that modify system gamma instead of window's.

                                D3D10 and D3D11 supporting Flip Model doesn't mean that game actually uses it (Unity and UE4 implemented Flip Model support around 2019 - 7 years after its release!).
                                <br>
                                Flip Model in Windowed Mode can be enabled in those games using Special K (D3D11 only) or Windows 11's (22H2) Optimizations for Windowed Games (both D3D10 and D3D11)

                                Nvidia drivers can also interop Vulkan and OpenGL to DXGI with Flip Model since driver version 526, albeit as the time of writing, OpenGL interop degrades performance compared to Special K's one,

                            You can ignore this section if you have following GPUs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nvidia 16 series and newer</li>

                            <li>Intel CPUs 8th Gen and newer</li>

                    <p>
                        Make sure your Windows is activated, otherwise the watermark will kick the game into the DWM composition, which leads to increased latency, worse performance and disables VRR.
                        <br>
                        If you don't have a GPU with <a href="#Terminology">MPO (Multiplane Overlay)</a> support, you can mitigate this by disabling Fullscreen Optimizations.
                        <br>
                        (Keep in mind that this trick won't work on modern, D3D12 games, so it's still recommended to just activate Windows)

                        <br>
                        How to check if your GPU supports MPOs:

                            Type <b class="card-basic">dxdiag</b> into Windows search

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Open the <b class="card-basic">DxDiag.txt</b> file, press <b class="card-basic">Ctrl+F</b> and look for <b class="card-basic">MPO MaxPlanes</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the number is <b>greater than 1</b>, then your GPU has MPO support.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>

                            Having the watermark without MPOs will disable VRR and increase input latency and stuttering!

                    <h3>Virtualization</h3>
                    Windows 11 uses virtualization features to increase system and inter-process security. Unfortunately, this can come at a performance cost, especially on lower-end hardware.
                    <br>
                    I won't be writing on how to disable them, because... <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/options-to-optimize-gaming-performance-in-windows-11-a255f612-2949-4373-a566-ff6f3f474613" target="_blank">Microsoft already made a tutorial about it</a>.

                    <br>
                    This step is not mandatory, as when it comes to security, it's up to you to decide. Just letting you know that this exists, and even Microsoft acknowledges the fact that it can degrade perfomance.

                                While AMD enables Freesync for Fullscreen Windowed BitBlt surfaces, Nvidia allows G-Sync to run with <i>any</i> window.
                                <br>
                                This is problematic because refresh rate can get synchronized to wrong windows, framerate may break on other displays and display stutters may occur.
                                <br>
                                Enabling it globally is a bad idea, because it disrupts normal desktop usage (e.g. screen can sync to sleeping windows).
                                <br>
                                It's recommended to use <a href="https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases/latest" target="_blank">Nvidia Profile Inspector</a> to set <b>G-Sync Application Mode</b> to
                                "<b>Fullscreen and Windowed</b>" in <b>Fallout - New Vegas</b> profile. This makes Windowed G-Sync run only when Fallout New Vegas is running.
                                <br>
                                <b>Keep in mind that even with this method, this G-Sync implementation is still buggy - if you get any of the forementioned issues, disable it.</b>

                    <h3>(Not) Pushing the Limits</h3>
                    Limiting framerate is very important for overall stability.
                    <br>
                    First and foremost, if you are using a good limiter, you'll be implementing correct framepacing, which is the most important think for the overall fell of fluidity.
                    <br>
                    More advanced limiters can also reduce latency or power consumption (it's difficult to have both).
                    <div class="card-red">
                        <p>
                            Always limit your framerate to an amount you can actually achieve, otherwise you won't get any benefits!
                            <br>
                            Letting your GPU overwork itself has a big latency impact, so try to cap your framerate at such value, where your GPU doesn't sit at constant 100% usage.
                            <br>
                            Running at smoother, lower framerate is always better than high, albeit laggy and stuttery one.

                                    Framerate must be capped slightly below refresh rate to reduce latency.

                            Not directly, no. As long as you don't go over your VRAM budget you'll be fine. If you run out of VRAM, you'll either crash, or experience massive stutters.
                            <br>
                            What <i>is</i> guaranteed from higher resolution textures is increase in their load time. This can translate into longer stutter periods on cell loads.
