                        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
                        Goal of this guide is to fix the abysmal performance in Fallout: New Vegas by using more modern technologies and tweaks, and make you generally aware of its quirks and other potential issues.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The guide is mostly written with an assumption that you've completed <b>Utilities</b> sections from

                            but it'll still cover mods contained within those guides.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the guide is focused on this particular game, most stuff shown here is applicable to other games.

                            Content presented here may seem insanely long, but that's really just because I'm trying to explain everything in detail to reduce further questions and confusion - sadly there's a lot of "gotchas" when it comes to PC hardware and its configurations.

                    <h3>Why?</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's be honest here, the engine did not age well. The renderer is based on now <span id="d3d9_year">22</span> year old DirectX 9, which fails to fit-in with modern GPUs and Windows.
                        It's extremely inefficient and CPU bound, has glaring issues with display modes, memory handling and overall stability.
                        <br>
                        As for Bethesda's code - it also fails (horribly) to scale well with modern processors, something that you can see even in their latest titles.
                        <br>
                        To make things worse, Fallout: New Vegas was compiled without compiler optimizations, which while making engine modding easier, reduces the overall performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short most performance issues can be summed with two words: <b>CPU bottleneck</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even with that fact in mind, there are some tweaks to be done on the GPU and presentation side of things that can help with the overall responsiveness of the game, despite not fixing the performance on its own.

                        <li id="VSync">
                            <b>Vertical Synchronization (V-Sync)</b> - technology allowing to keep display's scanout and refresh in phase to eliminate screen tearing,
                            at the cost of higher latency.
                            <br>
                            (Latency lowers along with refresh rate)
                        </li>
                        <li id="VRR">
                            <b>G-Sync | FreeSync</b> - <b>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</b> technologies developed by Nvidia and AMD respectively.
                            They allow the display to adapt its refresh rate to the framerate, allowing to use V-Sync at arbitrary framerates and reduce its latency<sup><a title="Why?" href="#annotation1">[1]</a></sup> .
                        </li>
                        <li id="MPO">
                            <b>Multiplane Overlays (MPOs)</b> - hardware scanout planes for the GPU. They allow for hardware image composition without any latency or performance penalty (for example displaying windows on top of each other), as well as
                            their hardware scaling and stretching.
                            MPOs are supported since Windows 8.1. Hardware capabilities vary between GPU manufacturers.
                        </li>
                        <li id="latency">
                            <b>Input Latency (lag)</b> - time between input event (mouse click, keyboard press) and the event being displayed on the screen. The lower the latency, the more responsive the game feels.
                            <br>
                            There are multiple sources of latency, varying from GPU/CPU usage, display mode, framerate count and many more - most of them are covered in this guide.
                        </li>

                                Yes, despite popular misinformation, VRR alone doesn't get rid of tearing. It can minimize the rolling tear however, but that varies between displays, and such, it's not a guaranteed feature.
                                Additionally, the latency reduction applies <b>only</b> at framerates below V-Sync window (display's native refresh rate) - if framerate matches the native refresh rate, VRR engages V-Sync emulation.

                                <br>
                                Allows "fullscreen-level" of performance and latency. Has native VRR support in Windowed mode. Additionally, DXGI version supports tearing (V-Sync off) in Windowed mode, HDR and has Multiplane Overlay (MPO) support.

                                DXGI variant is supported only in D3D10 and upwards<sup><a title="Why?" href="#annotation2">[2]</a></sup>, enforced only in D3D12, and exists only on Windows 8 and upwards.

                                D3D9Ex Flip Model is not feature matched and lacks any DXGI improvements.

                                While performing similarly to Flip Model in Fullscreen, in Windowed mode it has worse performance and always-on V-Sync on top of already additional latency caused by additional copy operations due to being software composed.

                                Has slow Alt-Tab due to display ownership transfer, can be problematic if games are badly coded and switch to odd resolutions or refresh rates by default. Can lose color profiles.
                                Despite that, it offers the best feature compatibility and perfomance for games that don't use Flip Model. Deprecated by Fullscreen Optimizations and Windowed with Flip Model for DirectX games.

                                <br>
                                Because of being a Windowed mode under the hood, it can break e.g. brightness control in old games that modify system gamma instead of window's.

                                Flip Model in Windowed mode can be enabled in those games using Special K (D3D11 only) or Windows 11's (22H2) Optimizations for Windowed Games (both D3D10 and D3D11).
                                <br>
                                Both implementations have good compatiblity, but there are some niche cases where a game can be unsupported by Special K, but supported by Windows - and vice versa.
                                <br>
                                Special K is recommended only for single player games due to anti-cheat concerns (it's a mod after all), while Windows' method is safe to use anywhere due to being a system feature.

                                OpenGL can be displayed using D3D11 thanks to Special K, which enables Flip Model and all its benefits along with HDR.
                                <br>
                                Nvidia drivers can interop Vulkan and OpenGL to DXGI with Flip Model since driver version 526.
                                OpenGL interop by default degrades performance, while DXVK compatibility requires toggling a flag in Nvidia Profile Inspector - see <a href="#dxvk-flip">here</a> how to resolve both of these issues.
                                <br>
                                AMD drivers have a D3D12 interop for OpenGL that can be toggled by enabling triple buffering in Radeon Settings. Vulkan interop is enabled automatically in Windowed mode.
                                <br>
                                However, due to how it's implemented, it can cause crashes with games or mods that spawn both D3D12 and OpenGL devices.

                    NVTF fixes and improves game's internal clocks and memory management, dramatically <strong>reducing stutter</strong>.
                    <br>
                    It also allows playing <strong>above 60 FPS</strong> without breaking physics, although the recommended limit should be set to 120 FPS or below.
                    <br>
                    Additionally, it has some DirectX changes, which help with <strong>performance</strong> and greatly reduce memory usage.

                                D3D9 loses the graphics device if it loses the screen ownership (Alt-Tab, Sleep, etc.). To recover, it needs to either have a copy of textures in RAM, or be able to reconstruct the memory from ground up.
                                <br>
                                Fallout: New Vegas, like most D3D9 games, use the first method. Thus by disabling this behavior, after Alt-Tabbing, game is in a limbo where it doesn't know what to do.
                                <br>
                                DXVK fixes this by simply being in place of D3D9, while Windowed mode guarantees the game will never own the screen in the first place.

                    <h3 id="zlibUpdated">zlib Updated</h3>
                    Fallout: New Vegas compresses its BSA archives and plugins (NPC and Landscape records) using <a href="https://www.zlib.net/" target="_blank">zlib</a>, which on its own does not belong to the <a href="https://github.com/lz4/lz4?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmarks" target="_blank">fastest compression algorithms</a>, especially considering that the version used in the game is very outdated.
                    <br>
                    By simply updating the library to the latest version, you can cut the time spent on decompression in <b>half</b>, which leads to faster loading times and less stuttering.
                    <div class="card-yellow">
                        <p>
                            This mod works only in cases where you actually <b>have</b> such compressed data in the first place.
                            <br>
                            Most mods from 2024 should not have plugin compression, and we decompress vanilla game files using <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65854" target="_blank">BSA Decompressor</a> or by <a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/" target="_blank">Tale of Two Wastelands</a>. In such cases, this mod won't have any effect, as there's nothing to do in the first place.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Unfortunately, there are a lot of older (and even new) mods with compression applied (even <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664" target="_blank">Yukichigai Unofficial Patch - YUP</a> itself).
                            <br>
                            In such cases it's recommended to actually decompress your plugins, which can be very easily done by following <a href="https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/decompress.html" target="_blank">this guide</a>. Prevention is better than mitigation, and costs nothing.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Mods with BSA archives are already rare on Nexus, and usually recent, so most often they are not using compression, or deliberately compressed due to their large sizes. Using the plugin in such cases is more sensible.

                    <br>
                    Without these offsets, the game has to scan all plugins to find cells, which can take a lot of time, especially if you have a lot of mods installed.

                        Not much to say here - for the best compatibility and performance, you <b>must</b> be using the newest driver for your graphics card.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can check what GPU you have by opening Task Manager, and going to the Performance tab - the last GPU in the left pane should be your main one.
                        <br>
                        If you don't see any GPU there, that means your GPU is too old to use DXVK.

                            You can ignore this section if you have following GPUs:

                            <li>Nvidia 16 series and newer</li>

                    <p>
                        Make sure your Windows is activated, otherwise the watermark will kick the game into the <span class="abbreviation" title="Desktop Window Manager - Windows component responsible for displaying and managing windows">DWM</span> composition, which leads to increased latency, worse performance and disables VRR.
                        <br>
                        If you don't have a GPU with <a href="#Terminology">MPO (Multiplane Overlay)</a> support, you can mitigate this by disabling Fullscreen Optimizations.
                        <br>
                        (Keep in mind that this trick won't work on modern, D3D12 games, so it's still recommended to just activate Windows)

                        <br>
                        How to check if your GPU supports MPOs:

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Open the <span class="card-basic">DxDiag.txt</span> file, press <span class="card-basic">Ctrl+F</span> and look for <span class="card-basic">MPO MaxPlanes</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the number is <b>greater than 1</b>, then your GPU has MPO support.

                    <h3>Virtualization</h3>
                    Windows 11 uses virtualization features to increase system and inter-process security. Unfortunately, this can come at a performance cost, especially on lower-end hardware.
                    <br>
                    I won't be writing on how to disable them, because... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250915072205/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/options-to-optimize-gaming-performance-in-windows-11-a255f612-2949-4373-a566-ff6f3f474613" target="_blank">Microsoft already made a tutorial about it</a>.
                    <br>
                    (Note: 14.11.2025 - Microsoft has taken down the original article, and it's unknown why. Treat this as a potential warning that they may force these features on in the future, or change how they work).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This step is not mandatory, as when it comes to security, it's up to you to decide. Just letting you know that this exists, and that even Microsoft acknowledges the fact that it can degrade perfomance.

                    <h3>Power Plans and Modes</h3>
                    With Windows 10, Microsoft introduced <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/power-settings/configure-processor-power-management-options" target="_blank">power modes</a>, which are meant to be replacement for power plans in terms of power and perfomance management.
                    <br>
                    Power modes require the <b>Balanced power plan</b> to be active to work. If you're any other power plan, you won't be able to use them (On most modern systems, you may find that you don't even have other power plans at all because of this).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To change your power mode, go to <a href="ms-settings:powersleep">Power</a> settings, and select whatever highest performance option you have if the dropdown menu.
                    <div class="card-yellow">
                        <p>
                            On some older, or custom built machines you may not have selectable power modes at all - in that case, all that matters is just having the <b>Balanced power plan</b> active.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are on a laptop, power modes are saved per connecton state - selecting a mode while on battery will not change the mode when you plug in the charger, and vice versa.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="card-red">
                        <p>
                        <h3>Warning!</h3>
                        Using custom power plans is not recommended due to how integral the <b>Balanced power plan</b> is to Windows 10 and 11 at the low level.
                        <br>
                        It can break power management on modern hardware, and can lead to increased power consumption and/or decreased performance (or even mess up things like fan speed).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It is safer to customize the <b>Balanced power plan</b> to your liking, rather than using a custom one. (We all can agree this is not intuitive at all).

                    Windows 10 introduced a feature called <a href="ms-settings:gaming-gamemode">Game Mode</a>, which puts the system in a more gaming-friendly state.
                    <br>
                    Game Mode is a "power mode overlay", which means it requires power modes to work - the Balanced power plan must be active.

                    DXVK is an open source Direct3D 9-11 to Vulkan translator project lead by <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin">Philip Rebohle (doitsujin)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/misyltoad">Autumn (misyltoad)</a>. While created mainly for Linux, works <u>unofficially</u> on Windows.
                    <br>
                    In short, it allows you to run Fallout using the Vulkan API which has much lower draw call overhead than D3D9, which is one of the main performance limiting factors in this game.

                    <h3>Things to know</h3>
                    Due to the nature of DXVK and Vulkan itself, there are some things you should be aware of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                DXVK improves performance in mainly draw call (CPU) bound scenarios (e.g. draw distance, object count), and usually doesn't help much in GPU bound ones (e.g. resolution)
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        It is possible that DXVK won't change anything for you, or even make things worse
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Transparency multisampling uses dithering - (Vulkan handles alpha to coverage differently than drivers)</li>

                                        Due to the nature of this effect, its quality improves alongside the level of MSAA used. It's recommended to use at least 4x MSAA.

                            <br>
                            Due to the potentially complicated setup, it's recommended only for enthusiasts.

                    <h3>DXVK HDR-Mod</h3>
                    <a href="https://github.com/EndlesslyFlowering" target="_blank">Lilium (aka EndlesslyFlowering)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WallSoGB" target="_blank">I</a> created this alternative version of DXVK with the intention of adding HDR functionality to D3D9 games. It changes 2 major things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allows to display the game in HDR (10 or 16 bit).</li>
                        <li>Upgrades the precision with which the game calculates colors, greatly reducing banding - as long as you have a 10 bit display or better.</li>
                    </ul>

                    You can download this version of DXVK in the next step, in <b>Optional Files</b>.

                    <div class="card-yellow">
                        <p>
                            DXVK <b>doesn't perform any HDR tone mapping</b>, so you need to use <a href="https://github.com/Filoppi/PumboAutoHDR" target="_blank">Pumbo's ReShade AutoHDR</a>.
                            <br>
                            Failing to do so will result in washed out colors and incorrect brightness.
                            <hr>
                            The game's built-in screenshot function doesn't support HDR, so you need to use Game Bar, Steam or Nvidia Overlay instead.

                    Here's a comparison of four display modes you can use in this game. Situation is problematic mainly due to Vulkan and D3D9 using old <a href="#Flip" onclick="expandCard(flipTalkTop, flipTalk, 1)">presentation models</a>.

                    <br>
                    This section will enable Flip Model, as it offers the best performance and lowest latency. Unfortunately, due to neither D3D9 nor Vulkan supporting it natively, compromises have to be made.

                                While AMD enables FreeSync for Fullscreen Windowed BitBlt surfaces, Nvidia allows G-Sync to run with <i>any</i> window.

                                This is problematic because refresh rate can get synchronized to wrong windows, framerate may break on other displays and display stutters may occur.

                                Enabling it globally is a bad idea, because it disrupts normal desktop usage (e.g. screen can sync to sleeping windows).

                    <h3>(Not) Pushing the Limits</h3>
                    Limiting framerate is very important for overall stability.
                    <br>
                    First and foremost, if you are using a good limiter, you'll be implementing correct framepacing, which is the most important thing for the overall feel of fluidity.
                    <br>
                    More advanced limiters can also reduce latency or power consumption (it's difficult to have both).
                    <div class="card-red">
                        <p>
                            Always limit your framerate to an amount you can actually achieve, otherwise you won't get any benefits!
                            <br>
                            Letting your GPU overwork itself has a big latency impact, so try to cap your framerate at such value, where your GPU doesn't sit at constant 100% usage.
                            <br>
                            Running at smoother, lower framerate is always better than high, albeit laggy and stuttery one.

                    <h3>Recommended Setups</h3>
                    Recommended configurations based on selected display scenarios:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>V-Sync</h4>
                            The "default" option - choose this if you don't have Variable Refresh Rate display or don't mind slight latency.
                            <ul>
                                <li>The framerate must be capped slightly below refresh rate to reduce latency.</li>
                            </ul>

                                    V-Sync on its own is <i><u>NOT</u></i> a limiter. Using it as one introduces a <b>massive</b> latency penalty.
                                </p>

                            <h4>G-Sync | FreeSync</h4>
                            Choose this if you have a Variable Refresh Rate display, as it offers the best balance between latency and visual smoothness.
                            <ul>
                                <li>V-Sync must be enabled in order to fully get rid of tearing.</li>
                                <li>The framerate must be capped below your refresh rate in order for VRR to not disengage and fallback to V-Sync, as this causes a very big increase in latency.</li>
                            </ul>

                                    You can <strong>check if you are using VRR</strong> by going to the <b>Nvidia Control Panel</b> if you're on Nvidia or <b>Adrenalin's Display Settings</b> if you're on AMD.

                                    If the G-Sync tab is missing from NVCP, your display doesn't support it or doesn't have the feature enabled in the OSD.

                                    Nvidia users need to make sure that G-Sync is set to <b>Fullscreen</b> and that <b>Display Specific settings</b> are enabled. The <b>Windowed</b> option is problematic due to it being a hacky method.
                                    <br>
                                    Both of the settings are wrongly named so they do not actually directly refer to the display method.

                            Choose this if you want to reduce latency as much as possible, and don't mind tearing.

                                    Due to Bethesda's oversight, the V-Sync toggle in the launcher doesn't work.

                                    To disable V-Sync, in <b>FalloutCustom.ini</b> set the following:

                                    <p>

                                </div>
                                Disabling V-Sync through other means (Driver, DXVK) also works.
                                </p>

                    <br>
                    If you don't use, or not have VRR, it's best to limit your framerate to fractions of your refresh rate. (30 at 60hz, 72 at 144hz, etc.).
                    <br>
                    Having framerate capped to a value that's not a clean fraction of your refresh rate will cause microstuttering (For example 40 at 60hz).
                    <br>
                    <br>

                            <h4>Fake Fullscreen, Borderless Windowed, Fullscreen Windowed, Windowed Fullscreen - is there any difference?</h4>
                            No. All of these terms refer to the same thing - a borderless window that covers the whole screen. There's no official name for it, so people use different ways to describe it.
                            <br>
                            "Borderless Windowed" is the only outlier here, as it does not specifically imply fullscreen usage.

                            <h4>Why is the guide recommending using Windows' Game Mode? I heard that it's bad.</h4>
                            Most, if not all Game Mode stigma comes around from its <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2017/01/27/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-15019-pc/">initial implementation in 2017</a>.
                            <p>
                                That version of Game Mode had two (now removed due to issues) features:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Resource prioritization</b> - Game Mode would try to prioritize resources for the game, which led to issues with background applications, or breaking games themselves.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Flip Model upgrade for windowed games</b> - Original implementation tried to upgrade selected D3D9 and D3D11 games, but often faced an issue where games would not exit software composition, leading to increased lag and worse performance.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Modern Game Mode does not have these features, and instead focuses on generic Windows tweaks, like disabling background services (Windows Update, Search Indexing).
                                <br>
                                Additionally, some vendors like AMD are using it to detect games and apply their own optimizations (CPU scheduling in AMD's case).

                            Flip Model upgrade functionality has been moved into Windows itself, split between Fullscreen Optimizations (All Direct3D versions; Windows 10+) and Windowed Optimizations (Direct3D 10 and 11; Windows 11+).
                            <br>
                            These features are enabled by default and don't suffer from the issues of the original Game Mode.

                            <h4>Any way change brightness in Windowed mode?</h4>
                            Use <a href="https://reshade.me/" target="_blank">ReShade</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51577/" target="_blank">Dynavision</a> to change the brightness.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Do texture mods really have an impact on performance?</h4>
                            In most cases, no. As long as you don't go over your VRAM budget and use NVTF's memory pool patch you'll be fine. If you happen to run out of VRAM, you'll get a massive performance degradation, due to graphics memory being spilled over into RAM.
                            <br>
                            What <i>is</i> guaranteed from higher resolution textures is increase in their load time. This can translate into longer stutter periods on cell loads.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            If you are using a low-bandwidth or slow memory GPU (e.g. integrated graphics), you may see performance impact from higher resolution textures, as the memory bus gets saturated. Using high levels of anisotropic filtering can also negatively contribute to performance on such GPUs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>You talk about HDR. I thought FNV already had it?</h4>
                            HDR mentioned in game setting refers to HDR rendering, where game renders lighting passes in 16 bits per channel (instead of 8) and tonemaps the result. This leads to properly glowing lights thanks to the precision of using 65536 colors per channel instead of 256. (Glowing elements won't be clamped anymore, and will glow instead.)
                            <br>
                            Due to the old age of the game, this data is later converted to 8 bit SDR (HDR in Windows was added in 2017!). Additionally, D3D9 obviously doesn't support HDR output in the first place, hence the need for the DXGI interop.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>DXVK is breaking HDR after exiting the game!</h4>
                            Yes, unfortunately due to how <span class="abbreviation" title="Fullscreen Exclusive" onclick="expandCard(flipTalkTop, flipTalk, 1); location.href='#Flip'">FSE</span> works, in addition to lack of native Windows support from DXVK, it doesn't properly handle the HDR API.
                            <br>
                            If your GPU supports it, use <a href="#FlipModel">DXVK with DXGI</a> to resolve this issue.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Is dgVoodoo 2 a viable alternative to DXVK?</h4>
                            No. While it is true that you'd gain Windowed mode with Flip Model and HDR from it, in contrast to DXVK you are guaranteed to get lower perfomance due to the translation overhead.
                            <br>
                            If you can handle the performance loss, sure go ahead.

                            <h4>During ReShade installation, which API should I choose if I use DXVK?</h4>
                            Vulkan.
