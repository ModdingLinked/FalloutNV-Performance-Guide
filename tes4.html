                        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
                        Goal of this guide is to fix the abysmal performance in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion by using more modern technologies and tweaks, and make you generally aware of its quirks and other potential issues.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The guide is mostly written with an assumption that you've completed <b>Utilities</b> sections from <a href="https://gloryofcyrodiil.moddinglinked.com/utilities.html" target="_blank">Glory of Cyrodiil</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the guide is focused on this particular game, most stuff shown here is applicable to other games.

                    <h3>Why?</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's be honest here, the engine did not age well. The renderer is based on now 20 year old DirectX 9, which fails to fit-in with modern GPUs and Windows.
                        It's extremely inefficient and CPU bound, has glaring issues with display modes, memory handling and overall stability.
                        <br>
                        As for Bethesda's code - it also fails (horribly) to scale well with modern CPUs, something that you can see even in their latest titles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short most performance issues can be summed with two words: <b>CPU bottleneck</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even with that fact in mind, there are some tweaks to be done on the GPU and presentation side of things that can help with the overall responsiveness of the game, despite not fixing the performance on its own.

                            <b>Vertical Synchronization (V-Sync)</b> - technology allowing to keep display's scanout and refresh in phase to eliminate screen tearing,
                            at the cost of higher latency.
                            <br>
                            (Latency lowers along with refresh rate)
                        </li>

                            <b>G-Sync | Freesync</b> - <b>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</b> technologies developed by NVIDIA and AMD respectively.
                            They allow the display to adapt its refresh rate to the framerate, allowing to use V-Sync at arbitrary framerates and reduce its latency<sup><a title="Why?" href="#annotation1">[1]</a></sup> .
                        </li>
                        <li id="MPO">
                            <b>Multiplane Overlays (MPOs)</b> - hardware scanout planes for the GPU. They allow for hardware image composition without any latency or performance penalty (for example displaying windows on top of each other), as well as
                            their hardware scaling and stretching.
                            MPOs are supported since Windows 8.1. Hardware capabilities vary between GPU manufacturers.

                                Yes, despite popular misinformation, VRR alone doesn't get rid of tearing. It can minimize the rolling tear however, but that varies between displays, and such, it's not a guaranteed feature.
                                Additionally, the latency reduction applies <b>only</b> at framerates below V-Sync window (display's native refresh rate) - if framerate matches the native refresh rate, VRR engages V-Sync emulation.

                                <br>
                                Allows "fullscreen-level" of performance and latency. Has native VRR support in Windowed Mode. Additionally, DXGI version supports tearing (V-Sync off) in Windowed Mode, HDR and has Multiplane Overlay (MPO) support.

                                D3D9Ex Flip Model is not feature matched and lacks any DXGI improvements.

                                While performing similarly to Flip Model in Fullscreen, in Windowed Mode it has worse performance and always-on V-Sync on top of already additional latency caused by additional copy operations due to being software composed.

                                The only presentation model for Windowed D3D9 (and lower), but still very common in D3D10 and D3D11 games.

                                Has slow Alt-Tab due to display ownership transfer, can be problematic if games are badly coded and switch to odd resolutions or refresh rates by default. Can lose color profiles.
                                Despite that, it offers the best feature compatibility and perfomance for games that don't use Flip Model. Deprecated by Fullscreen Optimizations and Windowed with Flip Model for DirectX games.

                                Because of being a Windowed Mode under the hood, it can break e.g. brightness control in old games that modify system gamma instead of window's.

                        You can check what GPU you have by opening Task Manager, and going to the Performance tab - the last GPU on the left pane is your main one.
                        <br>
                        If you don't see any GPU there, that means your GPU is too old to use DXVK.

                    <h3>Windows Watermark</h3>
                    <p>
                        Make sure your Windows is activated, otherwise the watermark will kick the game into the DWM composition, which leads to increased latency, worse performance and disables VRR.
                        If you don't have a GPU with <a href="#Terminology">MPO (Multiplane Overlay)</a> support, you can mitigate this by disabling Fullscreen Optimizations.
                        <br>
                        It's still weird to have unactivated Windows though.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        How to check if your GPU supports MPOs:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Type <b class="card-basic">dxdiag</b> into Windows search
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click <b>Save All Information</b> and save the file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Open the <b class="card-basic">DxDiag.txt</b> file, press <b class="card-basic">Ctrl+F</b> and look for <b class="card-basic">MPO MaxPlanes</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the number is <b>greater than 1</b>, then your GPU has MPO support.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>

                    <div class="card-red">
                        <p>
                            Having the watermark without MPOs will disable VRR and increase latency and stuttering!

                                This applies only to <b>D3D9 with Fullscreen Optimizations</b> and <b>DXVK with DXGI</b>, since D3D9 Windowed is already in the composed mode, and DXVK uses <span title="Fullscreen Exclusive" onclick="expandCard(flipTalkTop, flipTalk, 1); location.href='#Flip'">FSE</span>.
                                <br>
                                If you have:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Nvidia 16 series and newer</li>

                            You can also ignore it, since these models have Multiplane Overlays.

                    <h3>Virtualization</h3>
                    Windows 11 uses virtualization features to increase OS and inter-process security. Unfortunately, this can come at a performance cost, especially on lower-end hardware.
                    <br>
                    I won't be writing on how to disable them, because... <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/options-to-optimize-gaming-performance-in-windows-11-a255f612-2949-4373-a566-ff6f3f474613" target="_blank">Microsoft already made a tutorial about it</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This step is not mandatory, as when it comes to security, it's up to you to decide. Just letting you know that this exists, and even Microsoft acknowledges the fact that it can degrade perfomance.

                                While AMD enables Freesync for Fullscreen Windowed BitBlt surfaces, Nvidia allows G-Sync to run with <i>any</i> window.
                                <br>
                                This is problematic because refresh rate can get synchronized to wrong windows, framerate may break on other displays and display stutters may occur.

                                Enabling it globally is a bad idea, because it disrupts normal desktop usage (e.g. screen can sync to sleeping windows).

                    <h3>Translation Magic</h3>
                    DXVK is an open source Direct3D 9-11 to Vulkan translator project lead by <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin">doitsujin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton">Joshua Ashton</a>. While created mainly for Linux, works <u>unofficially</u> on Windows.
                    <br>
                    In short, it allows to run Fallout using Vulkan API which has benefits of much lower draw call overhead than D3D9,
                    which is one of the main performance limiting factors in this game.
                    <div class="card-yellow">
                        <p>
                            If you use Linux, most of this is irrelevant, since Proton on Linux obviously uses DXVK already.

                                    DXVK improves performance in mainly draw call (CPU) bound scenarios (e.g. draw distance), and usually doesn't help much in GPU bound ones (e.g. resolution)

                                Because of that you can experience increased short stutter at the beginning of your playthrough.
                                <br>
                                This is completely normal, and will not reoccur after compilation has finished.

                    <h3>(Not) Pushing the Limits</h3>
                    Limiting framerate is very important for overall stability.
                    <br>
                    First and foremost, if you are using a good limiter, you'll be implementing correct framepacing, which is the most important think for the overall fell of fluidity.
                    <br>
                    More advanced limiters can also reduce latency or power consumption (It's difficult to have both).
                    <div class="card-red">
                        <p>
                            Always limit your framerate to an amount you can actually achieve, otherwise you won't get any benefits!
                            <br>
                            Letting your GPU overwork itself has a big latency impact, so try to cap your framerate at such value, where your GPU doesn't sit at constant 100% usage.
                            <br>
                            Running at smoother, lower framerate is always better than high, albeit laggy and stuttery one.

                                    Framerate must be capped slightly below refresh rate to reduce latency.

                        Special K is a mod by <a href="https://github.com/Kaldaien" target="_blank">Kaldaien</a> focused mainly on fixing performance in games and implementing HDR.
                        <br>
                        Its list of features is too long to write here, but the most important one used here is its <b>incredibly versatile limiter</b> and if using DXGI, <b>HDR</b> and (almost) lagless V-Sync.

                            You can use <a href="https://reshade.me/" target="_blank">ReShade</a> to change the gamma.

                            <h4>Do texture mods really have an impact on performance?</h4>
                            Not directly, no. As long as you don't go over your VRAM budget and use ORC's memory pool patch you'll be fine. If you run out of VRAM, you'll either crash, or experience massive stutters.
                            <br>
                            What <i>is</i> guaranteed from higher resolution textures is increase in their load time. This can translate into longer stutter periods on cell loads.

                            <h4>DXVK is breaking HDR after exiting the game!</h4>
                            Yes, unfortunately due to how <span title="Fullscreen Exclusive" onclick="expandCard(flipTalkTop, flipTalk, 1); location.href='#Flip'">FSE</span> works, in addition to lack of native Windows support from DXVK, it doesn't properly handle the HDR API.
                            <br>
                            If you have a Nvidia GPU, use <a href="#DXVK">DXVK with DXGI</a> (You'll get actual HDR too!). Otherwise, normal Windowed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Is dgVoodoo 2 a viable alternative to DXVK?</h4>
                            No. While it is true that you'd gain Windowed mode with Flip Model and HDR from it, in contrast to DXVK you are guaranteed to get lower perfomance due to the translation overhead.
                            <br>
