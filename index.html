                <h3>Terminology:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Vertical Synchronization (V-Sync)</b> - technology that keeps display's scanout and refresh
                        in phase
                        to eliminate screen tearing, at the cost of higher display latency. (Latency lowers
                        along with refresh rate)</li>
                    <li><b>G-Sync/ Freesync</b> - Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) technologies developed by NVIDIA and AMD
                        respectively. Somewhat an extension (but also not) to V-Sync, allows monitor to adapt its
                        refresh rate
                        to the
                        framerate, which allows for stutter reduction and tear-free display of mismatched<sup>[1]</sup>
                        framerates with lower
                        input latency.</li>
                    <li><b>Flip Model</b> - presentation model first added in Windows 7 with
                        D3D9ex and later perfected in Windows 8<br> and 10,
                        allows fullscreen-level of
                        performance, latency and VRR in windowed modes. Since DXGI 1.5 it also support disabling V-Sync
                        in
                        windowed
                        mode and HDR.
                        <br>DXGI one is supported only in D3D10 and upwards<sup>[2]</sup>, enforced only in D3D12.
                        D3D9Ex doesn't use DXGI, so its Flip Model is not feature matched.
                        <br>More information <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dxgi-flip-model/">here</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>BitBlt Model</b> - older presentation model used by applications that don't use Flip Model.
                        Lacks all
                        of its advantages, and when used in Windowed mode, has potential performance problems and
                        always-on
                        V-Sync on top of already additional latency.
                        <br>
                        The only presentation model for windowed D3D9 (and lower).
                        <p>
                            Vulkan and OpenGL<sup>[3]</sup> don't use BitBlt nor Flip (Vulkan's swapchain is very
                            similar to Flip Model though) so they miss all their features
                            and gain their flaws when Windowed. VRR and tearing work only in FSO/FSE. HDR works only for
                            Vulkan titles that use NVIDIA's D3D11 interop.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Display modes:</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Fullscreen Exclusive (FSE)</b> - legacy method of displaying content where application
                            takes
                            complete ownership of the screen. Causes slow alt-tab, can be problematic if games are badly
                            coded
                            and switch to odd resolutions or refresh rates by default. Causes problems with color
                            profiles.
                            Supports VRR, downscaling and upscaling.<br>
                            Since W10 1803, the only application that should be using this mode is Display Window
                            Manager (DWM)
                            itself.
                            <br>Supported by every graphics API other than D3D12.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Fullscreen with Fullscreen Optimizations (FSO)</b> - an update to FSE added in Windows 10
                            1803.
                            Makes applications run in borderless mode (with Flip Model) for faster alt-tab, adds support
                            for windowed
                            overlays and better color
                            profile handling, while retaining all benefits of FSE despite having DWM as the screen
                            owner.
                            <br>Enabled by default for every application.

                            <b>Windowed/ Windowed Borderless</b> - method of displaying content in a window, managed by
                            DWM. Due
                            to being a window, alt-tab is fast, and color profiles usually don't have any problems. If
                            not using
                            Flip Model, it's worse in performance compared to FSO/FSE, lacks VRR support and uses
                            always-on
                            V-Sync.

                    <li>
                        I'm saying "mismatched", because tear-free, no-latency experience is possible with stable
                        framerates on normal displays by
                        manually
                        managing frame scanout (Special K Latent Sync, FPS Monitor Cyber Sync, RTSS Scanline Sync).
                        <br>
                        It requires some thinkering to work though, and is not guaranteed to work on every display at
                        default timings. (Mentioned programs are in order by their ease of use)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        D3D10 and D3D11 supporting Flip Model, doesn't mean that game uses it (Unity and UE4 implemented
                        Flip Model support around 2019).
                        <br>
                        Flip Model can be enabled in those games using Special K (D3D11 only) or Windows 11's (22H1)
                        Optimizations for Windowed Games (both D3D10 and D3D11).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        OpenGL can be converted to D3D11 using Special K, which enables Flip Model and all its benefits
                        along with HDR.
                        <br>
                        Some OpenGL games also get converted to D3D11 by drivers when using Intel GPU as display output
                        while NVIDIA GPU renders the game (Not checked on AMD systems).
                        <br>
                        Games converted this way don't use Flip Model, so Special K or W11 22H1 is needed. (SK's HDR
                        doesn't work this way. Windows' AutoHDR should)
