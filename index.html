                                They allow the display to adapt its refresh rate to the framerate,
                                which in turn allows for stutter reduction and tear-free display of unstable framerate<sup><a href="#ad1">[1]</a></sup>,

                                    Allows "fullscreen-level" of performance and latency. Has native VRR support in Windowed mode. Additionally, DXGI version supports tearing (V-Sync off) in Windowed mode, HDR and has Multiplane Overlay (MPO) support.

                                    D3D9Ex Flip Model is not feature matched and lacks any DXGI improvements.

                                    Lacks all of its advantages, and when used in Windowed mode, has worse performance and always-on V-Sync on top of already additional latency caused by additional copy operations.
                                    <br>
                                    The only presentation model for Windowed D3D9 (and lower), but still very common in D3D10 and D3D11 games.

                                While Vulkan and OpenGL<sup><a href="#ad3">[3]</a></sup> don't use aforementioned Presentation Modes in FSE, their windows are GDI-based, so they use BitBlt.

                                    <b>Fullscreen Exclusive (FSE)</b> - legacy method of displaying content where application takes complete ownership of the screen.
                                    Has slow Alt-Tab due to display ownership transfer, can be problematic if games are badly coded and switch to odd resolutions or refresh rates by default. Can lose color profiles.
                                    Despite that, it offers the best feature compatibility and perfomance for games that don't use Flip Model. Deprecated by FSO for DirectX games.

                                    <b>Fullscreen with Fullscreen Optimizations (FSO)</b> - an update to FSE for DirectX added in Windows 10 1803.
                                    <br>
                                    Converts DirectX applications running in FSE mode into a pseudo borderless mode with Flip Model for faster Alt-Tab,
                                    lower latency, better color profile handling, and support for Windowed overlays (Xbox Game Bar, volume and brightness sliders etc.).
                                    <br>
                                    Because of being a Windowed mode under the hood, it can break e.g. brightness control in old games that modify system gamma instead of window's.

                                    D3D10 and D3D11 supporting Flip Model doesn't mean that game actually uses it (Unity and UE4 implemented Flip Model support around 2019 - 7 years after its release!).
                                    <br>
                                    Flip Model in Windowed mode can be enabled in those games using Special K (D3D11 only) or Windows 11's (22H2) Optimizations for Windowed Games (both D3D10 and D3D11)

                                    OpenGL can be displayed using D3D11 thanks to Special K, which enables Flip Model and all its benefits along with HDR.
                                    <br>
                                    Most OpenGL games also get displayed as D3D11 by Nvidia drivers when using Nvidia GPU as a render device, but not as a display output. This happens mostly on laptops, but works on desktops too.
                                    Games converted this way don't use Flip Model, so Special K or Windows 11 (22H2) is needed

                        New Vegas Tick Fix is a mod by <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/31254295">karut</a> that fixes and improves game's internal clocks and memory management, which dramatically reduces stutter. It also allows for
                        playing above 60fps without breaking physics.

                        Additionally, it has some DirectX changes, which help with performance and greatly reduce memory usage.

                        <h3>Translation magic</h3>
                        DXVK is a Direct3D 9-11 to Vulkan translation layer created mainly for Linux, but works <u>unofficially</u> on Windows.
                        <br>
                        In short, it makes possible to run Fallout using Vulkan API which has benefits of much lower drawcall overhead than D3D9,
                        which is one of the main performance limiting factors in this game.

                                        DXVK improves performance in mainly drawcall (CPU) bound scenarios (e.g. draw distance), and usually doesn't help much in GPU bound ones (e.g. resolution)
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>

                                                It is possible that DXVK won't change anything for you, or even make things worse

                                        DXVK's GPU compatibility varies between manufacturers

                                                Nvidia GPU laptops with integrated graphics fail to run DXVK properly on Windows, resulting in worse than native performance.
                                                <br>
                                                Unless you can use Nvidia GPU as the display output (e.g. MUX switch), it's recommended to stay away from DXVK on those devices until this issue is fixed

                                        In Fallout: New Vegas known shader issues are:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Broken Transparency Multisampling (grass and transparent objects are not anti-aliased properly)</li>

                                    </ul>
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    Due to DXVK's nature it relies on shader cache, which is compiled during the first use of that shader.
                                    <br>
                                    Because of that you can experience increased short stutter at the beginning of your playthrough.
                                    <br>
                                    This is completely normal, and will not reoccur after compilation has finished.

                        <h3>(Not) Pushing the limits</h3>
                        Limiting framerate is very important for overall stability. A good limiter will most importantly improve framepacing, reducing microstutter. Other benefits are reduced latency and power consumption.
                        <div class="card-red">
                            <p>
                                Always limit your framerate to an amount you can actually achieve, otherwise you won't get any benefits!
                                <br>
                                Letting your GPU overwork itself has a big latency impact, so try to cap your framerate at such value, where your GPU doesn't sit at constant 100% usage

                                Remember that V-Sync needs to be enabled for proper VRR functionality. You can enable it in game or through driver.

                            If you don't use, or have VRR, it's best to limit your framerate in full intervals. (30 at 60hz, 72 at 144hz, etc.)
