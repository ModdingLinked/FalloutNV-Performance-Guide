                                <b>Vertical Synchronization (V-Sync)</b> - technology allowing to keep display's scanout and refresh in phase to eliminate screen tearing,
                                at the cost of higher latency
                                <br>
                                (Latency lowers along with refresh rate)

                                <b>G-Sync | Freesync</b> - <b>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</b> technologies developed by NVIDIA and AMD respectively.
                                They allow the display to adapt its refresh rate to the framerate, allowing to use V-Sync at arbitrary framerates and reduce its latency<sup><a href="#ad1">[1]</a></sup> .
                            </li>

                                <b>Multiplane Overlays (MPOs)</b> - hardware scanout planes for the GPU. They allow for hardware image composition without any latency or performance penalty (for example displaying windows on top of each other), as well as
                                their hardware scaling and stretching.
                                MPOs are supported since Windows 8.1. Hardware capabilities vary between GPU manufacturers.

                                    <b>Flip Model</b> - presentation model first added in Windows 7 with D3D9Ex and upgraded in DXGI in Windows 8-10.
                                    <br>
                                    Allows "fullscreen-level" of performance and latency. Has native VRR support in Windowed Mode. Additionally, DXGI version supports tearing (V-Sync off) in Windowed Mode, HDR and has Multiplane Overlay (MPO) support.
                                    <br>
                                    DXGI variant is supported only in D3D10 and upwards<sup><a href="#ad2">[2]</a></sup>, enforced only in D3D12, and exists only on Windows 8 and upwards.
                                    <br>
                                    D3D9Ex Flip Model is not feature matched and lacks any DXGI improvements.

                                    <b>BitBlt Model</b> - older presentation model used by most applications.
                                    While performing similarly to Flip Model in Fullscreen, in Windowed Mode it has worse performance and always-on V-Sync on top of already additional latency caused by additional copy operations.
                                    <br>
                                    The only presentation model for Windowed D3D9 (and lower), but still very common in D3D10 and D3D11 games.

                                    <b>Fullscreen Exclusive (FSE)</b> - legacy method of displaying content where application takes complete ownership of the screen.
                                    Has slow Alt-Tab due to display ownership transfer, can be problematic if games are badly coded and switch to odd resolutions or refresh rates by default. Can lose color profiles.
                                    Despite that, it offers the best feature compatibility and perfomance for games that don't use Flip Model. Deprecated by FSO and Windowed with Flip Model for DirectX games.
                                    <br>
                                    Supported by every graphics API other than D3D12

                                    <b>Fullscreen with Fullscreen Optimizations (FSO)</b> - an update to FSE for DirectX added in Windows 10 1803.
                                    <br>
                                    Converts DirectX applications running in FSE mode into a pseudo borderless mode with Flip Model for faster Alt-Tab,
                                    lower latency, better color profile handling, and support for Windowed overlays (Xbox Game Bar, volume and brightness sliders etc.).
                                    <br>
                                    Because of being a Windowed Mode under the hood, it can break e.g. brightness control in old games that modify system gamma instead of window's.
                                    <br>

                                    <b>Windowed</b> - method of displaying content in a window, always managed by DWM. Due to being a window, Alt-Tab is fast, and color profiles usually don't have any problems.
                                    If not using Flip Model, it has worse performance compared to FSO | FSE, lacks native VRR support, has increased input latency and uses always-on V-Sync

                                    Yes, despite popular misinformation, VRR alone doesn't get rid of tearing. It can minimize the rolling tear however, but that varies between displays, and such, it's not a guaranteed feature.
                                    Additionally, the latency reduction applies <b>only</b> at framerates below V-Sync window (display's native refresh rate) - if framerate matches the native refresh rate, VRR engages V-Sync emulation.
                                </li>

                                    D3D10 and D3D11 supporting Flip Model doesn't mean that game actually uses it (Unity and UE4 implemented Flip Model support around 2019 - 7 years after its release!).
                                    <br>
                                    Flip Model in Windowed Mode can be enabled in those games using Special K (D3D11 only) or Windows 11's (22H2) Optimizations for Windowed Games (both D3D10 and D3D11)

                                    OpenGL can be displayed using D3D11 thanks to Special K, which enables Flip Model and all its benefits along with HDR.

                                    Nvidia drivers can also interop Vulkan and OpenGL to DXGI with Flip Model since driver version 526, albeit as the time of writing, OpenGL interop degrades performance compared to Special K's one,
                                    while DXVK compatibility requires toggling a flag in Nvidia Profile Inspector - see <a href="#dxvk-flip">here</a>.

                            Make sure your Windows is activated, otherwise the watermark will kick the game into the DWM composition.
                            If you don't have a GPU with MPO (Multiplane Overlay) support, you can mitigate this by disabling Fullscreen Optimizations.
                        </p>
                        It's still weird to have unactivated Windows though.

                                Having the watermark without MPOs will disable VRR and increase latency and stuttering!

                                This applies only to D3D9 with FSO and DXVK with DXGI, since D3D9 Windowed is already in the composed mode, and DXVK uses FSE.

                        DXVK is an open source Direct3D 9-11 to Vulkan translator project lead by <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin">doitsujin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton">Joshua Ashton</a>. While created mainly for Linux, works
                        <u>unofficially</u> on Windows.
                        <br>
                        In short, it allows to run Fallout using Vulkan API which has benefits of much lower drawcall overhead than D3D9,
                        which is one of the main performance limiting factors in this game.

                                        DXVK improves performance in mainly drawcall (CPU) bound scenarios (e.g. draw distance), and usually doesn't help much in GPU bound ones (e.g. resolution)

                                        Fallout: New Vegas has some known shader issues. They are not guaranteed to happen, but they can occur:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Broken transparency multisampling - alpha textures are more translucent and aliased</li>
                                        <li>Broken grass rendering - grass gets a dither effect instead of smooth fade in the distance</li>
                                        <li>Broken water reflections</li>
                                        <li>Broken lights and artifacting</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                    Due to DXVK's nature it relies on shader cache, which is compiled during the first use of that shader.
                                    <br>
                                    Because of that you can experience increased short stutter at the beginning of your playthrough.
                                    <br>
                                    This is completely normal, and will not reoccur after compilation has finished.
                                    <br>
                                    DXVK-Async alleviates this problem thanks to making the compilation asynchronous

                                <h4>DXVK 2.0 resolves this on latest Nvidia drivers by precompiling shaders on launch, but async patch still applies to other GPUs.</h4>

                                    While AMD enables Freesync for Fullscreen Windowed non-Flip surfaces, Nvidia allows G-Sync to run with <i>any</i> window.
                                    <br>
                                    This is problematic because refresh rate can get synchronized to wrong windows, framerate may break on other displays and display stutters may occur.
                                    <br>
                                    Enabling it globally is a bad idea, because it disrupts normal desktop usage (e.g. screen can sync to sleeping windows).

                                    It's recommended to use <a href="https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases/latest" target="_blank">Nvidia Profile Inspector</a> to set <b>G-Sync Application Mode</b> to
                                    "<b>Fullscreen and Windowed</b>" in <b>Fallout - New Vegas</b> profile. This makes Windowed G-Sync run only when Fallout New Vegas is running.

                        <h3>(Not) Pushing the limits</h3>
                        Limiting framerate is very important for overall stability. A good limiter will most importantly improve framepacing, reducing microstutter. Other benefits could be reduced latency and power consumption.

                        <div class="card-red">
                            <p>
                                Always limit your framerate to an amount you can actually achieve, otherwise you won't get any benefits!
                                <br>
                                Letting your GPU overwork itself has a big latency impact, so try to cap your framerate at such value, where your GPU doesn't sit at constant 100% usage.
                                <br>
                                Running at smoother, lower framerate is much better than high, albeit laggy one.

                                        Framerate must be capped slightly below refresh rate to reduce latency

                                            V-Sync on its own is <u>NOT</u> a limiter. Using it as one introduces a latency penalty

                        Limiters presented here are ordered by their precision, from best to acceptable. The better ones are smoother and can provide better latency reductions, but are not as fast to setup compared to the built-in driver alternatives and
                        may have some compatibility issues.

                            too long to write here, but the most important one used here is its <b>best-in-class framerate limiter</b> and <b>HDR</b>.

                                <h4>Do texture mods really have an impact on performance?</h4>
                                Not directly, no. As long as you don't go over your VRAM budget and use NVTF's memory pool patch you'll be fine. If you run out of VRAM, you'll either crash, or experience massive stutters.
                                <br>
                                What <i>is</i> guaranteed from higher resolution textures is increase in their load time. This can translate into longer stutter periods on cell loads.

                                <h4>DXVK is breaking HDR after exiting the game!</h4>
                                Yes, unfortunately due to how FSE works, in addition to lack of native Windows support from DXVK, it doesn't properly handle the HDR API.
                                <br>
                                If you have a Nvidia GPU, use <a href="#DXVK">DXVK with DXGI</a> (You'll get actuall HDR too!). Otherwise, normal Windowed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Is dgVoodoo 2 a viable alternative to DXVK?</h4>
                                No. While it's true that you'd gain properly working Windowed mode and HDR from it, in contrast to DXVK you are guaranteed to get lower perfomance due to the translation overhead.
                                <br>
                                If you can handle the performance loss, sure go ahead.

                                <h4>Is it possible to use D3D9Ex in Fallout New Vegas?</h4>
                                Yes - Fallout New Vegas, oddly enough is the only Bethesda title with native D3D9Ex support. Does it work well? Not really.
                                <br>
                                While Special K's D3D9Ex enforcement works far better that NVTF's, it still suffers from CPU perfomance loss and increased GPU usage.
