                                <b>Vertical Synchronization (V-Sync)</b> - technology allowing to keep display's scanout and refresh in phase to eliminate screen tearing,
                                at the cost of higher latency
                                <br>
                                (Latency lowers along with refresh rate)

                                <b>G-Sync | Freesync</b> - <b>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</b> technologies developed by NVIDIA and AMD respectively.
                                They allow the display to adapt its refresh rate to the framerate,
                                which in turn allows for stutter reduction and tear-free display of unstable framerate<sup><a href="#ad1">[1]</a></sup>,
                                and with a proper FPS cap - lower latency compared to V-Sync
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Presentation models:</b></li>

                                    <b>Flip Model</b> - presentation model first added in Windows 7 with D3D9Ex and upgraded in DXGI in Windows 8-10.
                                    <br>
                                    Allows "fullscreen-level" of performance and latency. Has native VRR support in Windowed Mode. Additionally, DXGI version supports tearing (V-Sync off) in Windowed Mode, HDR and has Multiplane Overlay (MPO) support.
                                    <br>
                                    DXGI variant is supported only in D3D10 and upwards<sup><a href="#ad2">[2]</a></sup>, enforced only in D3D12, and exists only on Windows 8 and upwards.
                                    <br>
                                    D3D9Ex Flip Model is not feature matched and lacks any DXGI improvements.
                                    <br>

                                    <b>BitBlt Model</b> - older presentation model used by most applications.
                                    While performing similarly to Flip Model in Fullscreen, in Windowed Mode it has worse performance and always-on V-Sync on top of already additional latency caused by additional copy operations.
                                    <br>
                                    The only presentation model for Windowed D3D9 (and lower), but still very common in D3D10 and D3D11 games.
                                    <p>
                                        Vulkan and OpenGL<sup><a href="#ad3">[3]</a></sup> use BitBlt in Windowed Mode.

                                    <b>Fullscreen Exclusive (FSE)</b> - legacy method of displaying content where application takes complete ownership of the screen.
                                    Has slow Alt-Tab due to display ownership transfer, can be problematic if games are badly coded and switch to odd resolutions or refresh rates by default. Can lose color profiles.
                                    Despite that, it offers the best feature compatibility and perfomance for games that don't use Flip Model. Deprecated by FSO for DirectX games.
                                    <br>
                                    Supported by every graphics API other than D3D12

                                    <b>Fullscreen with Fullscreen Optimizations (FSO)</b> - an update to FSE for DirectX added in Windows 10 1803.
                                    <br>
                                    Converts DirectX applications running in FSE mode into a pseudo borderless mode with Flip Model for faster Alt-Tab,
                                    lower latency, better color profile handling, and support for Windowed overlays (Xbox Game Bar, volume and brightness sliders etc.).
                                    <br>
                                    Because of being a Windowed Mode under the hood, it can break e.g. brightness control in old games that modify system gamma instead of window's.
                                    <br>
                                    Enabled by default for every application.

                                    <b>Windowed</b> - method of displaying content in a window, always managed by DWM. Due to being a window, Alt-Tab is fast, and color profiles usually don't have any problems.
                                    If not using Flip Model, it has worse performance compared to FSO | FSE, lacks native VRR support, has increased input latency and uses always-on V-Sync

                                    Emphasis on unstable, because tear-free, no-latency experience is possible with stable framerates on fixed refresh rate displays by hiding the tearline in VBlank (see RTSS Scanline Sync, Special K Latent Sync, FPS
                                    Monitor
                                    Cyber Sync).

                                    It requires some tinkering to work though, and is not guaranteed to work on every display at default timings

                                    D3D10 and D3D11 supporting Flip Model doesn't mean that game actually uses it (Unity and UE4 implemented Flip Model support around 2019 - 7 years after its release!).
                                    <br>
                                    Flip Model in Windowed Mode can be enabled in those games using Special K (D3D11 only) or Windows 11's (22H2) Optimizations for Windowed Games (both D3D10 and D3D11)
                                </li>

                                    OpenGL can be displayed using D3D11 thanks to Special K, which enables Flip Model and all its benefits along with HDR.
                                    <br>
                                    Most OpenGL games also get displayed as D3D11 by Nvidia drivers when using Nvidia GPU as a render device, but not as a display output. This happens mostly on laptops, but works on desktops too.
                                    Games converted this way don't use Flip Model, so Special K or Windows 11 (22H2) is needed

                        New Vegas Tick Fix is a mod by <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/31254295" target="_blank">karut</a> that fixes and improves game's internal clocks and memory management, which dramatically reduces stutter. It also
                        allows for
                        playing above 60fps without breaking physics.
                        <br>
                        Additionally, it has some DirectX changes, which help with performance and greatly reduce memory usage.

                        DXVK is an open source Direct3D 9-11 to Vulkan translator project lead by <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin">doitsujin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton">Joshua Ashton</a>. While created mainly for Linux, works
                        <u>unofficially</u> on Windows.
                        <br>
                        In short, it allows to run Fallout using Vulkan API which has benefits of much lower drawcall overhead than D3D9,
                        which is one of the main performance limiting factors in this game.

                                        DXVK improves performance in mainly drawcall (CPU) bound scenarios (e.g. draw distance), and usually doesn't help much in GPU bound ones (e.g. resolution)

                                        Fallout: New Vegas has some known shader issues. They are not guaranteed to happen, but they can occur:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Broken transparency multisampling - alpha textures are more translucent, and are aliased</li>
                                        <li>Broken grass rendering - grass gets a dither effect instead of smooth fade in the distance</li>
                                        <li>Broken water reflections</li>
                                        <li>Broken lights and artifacting</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    Due to DXVK's nature it relies on shader cache, which is compiled during the first use of that shader.
                                    <br>
                                    Because of that you can experience increased short stutter at the beginning of your playthrough.
                                    <br>
                                    This is completely normal, and will not reoccur after compilation has finished.

                                    While AMD enables Freesync for Fullscreen Windowed non-Flip surfaces, Nvidia allows G-Sync to run with <i>any</i> window.
                                    <br>
                                    This is problematic because refresh rate can get synchronized to wrong windows, framerate may break on other displays and display stutters may occur.
                                    <br>
                                    Enabling it globally is a bad idea, because it disrupts normal desktop usage (e.g. screen can sync to sleeping windows).

                                    It's recommended to use <a href="https://github.com/FoulPlay/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases/latest" target="_blank">Nvidia Profile Inspector</a> to set <b>G-Sync Application Mode</b> to

                        <h3>(Not) Pushing the limits</h3>
                        Limiting framerate is very important for overall stability. A good limiter will most importantly improve framepacing, reducing microstutter. Other benefits could be reduced latency and power consumption.

                        <div class="card-red">
                            <p>
                                Always limit your framerate to an amount you can actually achieve, otherwise you won't get any benefits!
                                <br>
                                Letting your GPU overwork itself has a big latency impact, so try to cap your framerate at such value, where your GPU doesn't sit at constant 100% usage.
                                <br>
                                Running at smoother, lower framerate is much better than high, albeit laggy one.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Framerate must be capped slightly below refresh rate to reduce latency
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>G-Sync | Freesync</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                V-Sync must be enabled, in order to fully get rid of tearing
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Framerate must be capped below refresh rate, in order for VRR to not disengage and fallback to V-Sync - this causes very big increase in latency
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        If you play with V-Sync disabled, there's nothing besides the limiter to set up

                        <h3>Finding the limit</h3>

                                If you don't use, or not have VRR, it's best to limit your framerate in full intervals. (30 at 60hz, 72 at 144hz, etc.)

                        Limiters presented here are ordered by their precision, from best to acceptable. The better ones are smoother and can provide better latency reductions, but are not as fast to setup compared to the built-in driver alternatives and
                        may have some compatibility issues.
