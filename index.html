                        <h3>Why?</h3>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let's be honest here - the engine did not age well. The renderer is based on now 20 year old DirectX 9, which fails to fit-in with modern GPUs and Windows.
                            It's extremely inefficient and CPU bound, has glaring issues with display modes, memory handling and overall stability.
                            <br>
                            As for Bethesda's code - it also fails (horribly) to scale well with modern CPUs, something that you can see even in their latest titles.
                            <br>
                            To make things worse, Fallout New Vegas was compiled without compiler optimizations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In short most performance issues can be summed with two words - CPU bottleneck.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even with that fact in mind, there are some tweaks to be done on the GPU and presentation side of things that can help with the overall responsiveness of the game, despite not fixing the performance on its own.

                                They allow the display to adapt its refresh rate to the framerate, allowing to use V-Sync at arbitrary framerates and reduce its latency<sup><a title="Why?" href="#annotation1">[1]</a></sup> .

                                their hardware scaling and stretching.
                                MPOs are supported since Windows 8.1. Hardware capabilities vary between GPU manufacturers.

                                    Yes, despite popular misinformation, VRR alone doesn't get rid of tearing. It can minimize the rolling tear however, but that varies between displays, and such, it's not a guaranteed feature.
                                    Additionally, the latency reduction applies <b>only</b> at framerates below V-Sync window (display's native refresh rate) - if framerate matches the native refresh rate, VRR engages V-Sync emulation.

                                    D3D10 and D3D11 supporting Flip Model doesn't mean that game actually uses it (Unity and UE4 implemented Flip Model support around 2019 - 7 years after its release!).

                                    Flip Model in Windowed Mode can be enabled in those games using Special K (D3D11 only) or Windows 11's (22H2) Optimizations for Windowed Games (both D3D10 and D3D11)

                                    OpenGL can be displayed using D3D11 thanks to Special K, which enables Flip Model and all its benefits along with HDR.

                                    Nvidia drivers can also interop Vulkan and OpenGL to DXGI with Flip Model since driver version 526, albeit as the time of writing, OpenGL interop degrades performance compared to Special K's one,

                            Make sure your Windows is activated, otherwise the watermark will kick the game into the DWM composition, which leads to increased latency, worse performance and disables VRR.
                            If you don't have a GPU with <a href="#Terminology">MPO (Multiplane Overlay)</a> support, you can mitigate this by disabling Fullscreen Optimizations.

                            It's still weird to have unactivated Windows though.

                                If the number is <b>greater than 1</b>, then your GPU has MPO support.

                                Having the watermark without MPOs will disable VRR and increase latency and stuttering!

                        This step is not mandatory, as when it comes to security, it's up to you to decide. Just letting you know that this exists, and even Microsoft acknowledges the fact that it can degrade perfomance.

                                    While AMD enables Freesync for Fullscreen Windowed BitBlt surfaces, Nvidia allows G-Sync to run with <i>any</i> window.
                                    <br>
                                    This is problematic because refresh rate can get synchronized to wrong windows, framerate may break on other displays and display stutters may occur.

                                    Enabling it globally is a bad idea, because it disrupts normal desktop usage (e.g. screen can sync to sleeping windows).

                                    D3D9 loses the graphics device if it loses the screen ownership (Alt-Tab, Sleep, etc.). To recover, it needs to either have a copy of textures in RAM, or be able to reconstruct the memory from ground up.

                                    Fallout New Vegas, like most D3D9 games, use the first method. Thus by disabling this behavior, after Alt-Tabbing, game is in a limbo where it doesn't know what to do.

                        DXVK is an open source Direct3D 9-11 to Vulkan translator project lead by <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin">doitsujin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton">Joshua Ashton</a>. While created mainly for Linux, works
                        <u>unofficially</u> on Windows.
                        <br>
                        In short, it allows to run Fallout using Vulkan API which has benefits of much lower draw call overhead than D3D9,
                        which is one of the main performance limiting factors in this game.

                                        Fallout New Vegas has some known shader issues. They are not guaranteed to happen (getting rarer with DXVK updates), but they can occur:

                                    Due to DXVK's nature it relies on shader cache, which is compiled during the first use of that shader.

                                    Because of that you can experience increased short stutter at the beginning of your playthrough.

                        <h3>(Not) Pushing the limits</h3>
                        Limiting framerate is very important for overall stability.
                        <br>
                        First and foremost, if you are using a good limiter, you'll be implementing correct framepacing, which is the most important think for the overall fell of fluidity.
                        <br>
                        More advanced limiters can also reduce latency or power consumption (It's difficult to have both).
                        <div class="card-red">
                            <p>
                                Always limit your framerate to an amount you can actually achieve, otherwise you won't get any benefits!
                                <br>
                                Letting your GPU overwork itself has a big latency impact, so try to cap your framerate at such value, where your GPU doesn't sit at constant 100% usage.
                                <br>
                                Running at smoother, lower framerate is always better than high, albeit laggy and stuttery one.

                                        Special K may conflict with Riva Tuner. If the game crashes or SK doesn't show up in game, make sure <b>Riva Tuner</b> is <b>not running</b>, or set Riva Runer's <b>injection delay</b> to <b>30000</b>

                                        Special K's interface breaks water reflections when visible. This is fixed by DXVK. (Or simply just don't have it visible).

                                        Special K doesn't natively support <b>Vulkan</b>, so when using DXVK without DXGI it recognizes the game as D3D9.

                                <h4>Any way change brightness in Windowed Mode?</h4>
                                You can use <a href="https://reshade.me/" target="_blank">ReShade</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51577/" target="_blank">Dynavision</a> to change the gamma.

                                <h4>Do texture mods really have an impact on performance?</h4>
                                Not directly, no. As long as you don't go over your VRAM budget and use NVTF's memory pool patch you'll be fine. If you run out of VRAM, you'll either crash, or experience massive stutters.
                                <br>
                                What <i>is</i> guaranteed from higher resolution textures is increase in their load time. This can translate into longer stutter periods on cell loads.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>You talk about HDR. I thought FNV already had it?</h4>
                                HDR mentioned in game setting refers to HDR rendering, where game renders lighting passes in 16 bits, instead of 8. This leads to properly glowing lights thanks to the precision of using 65536 colors per channel instead of 256. (Glowing elements won't be clamped anymore, and will glow instead.)
                                <br>
                                Due to the old age of the game, this data is later converted to 8 bit SDR (HDR in Windows was added in 2017!). Additionally, D3D9 obviously doesn't support HDR output in the first place, hence the need for the DXGI interop.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>DXVK is breaking HDR after exiting the game!</h4>
                                Yes, unfortunately due to how <span title="Fullscreen Exclusive" onclick="expandCard(flipTalkTop, flipTalk, 1); location.href='#Flip'">FSE</span> works, in addition to lack of native Windows support from DXVK, it doesn't properly handle the HDR API.
                                <br>
                                If you have a Nvidia GPU, use <a href="#DXVK">DXVK with DXGI</a> (You'll get actual HDR too!). Otherwise, normal Windowed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Is dgVoodoo 2 a viable alternative to DXVK?</h4>
                                No. While it's true that you'd gain Windowed mode with Flip Model and HDR from it, in contrast to DXVK you are guaranteed to get lower perfomance due to the translation overhead.
                                <br>
                                If you can handle the performance loss, sure go ahead.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Is it possible to use D3D9Ex in Fallout New Vegas?</h4>
                                Technically yes - Fallout New Vegas, oddly enough is the only Bethesda title with native D3D9Ex support. Does it work well? Not really.
                                <br>
                                While Special K's D3D9Ex enforcement works far better that NVTF's, it still suffers from CPU perfomance loss and increased GPU usage.
